## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- JIRA API token
- OpenAI API key
- LangChain, Streamlit, Atlassian API, and other dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JIRA_AI_BOT.git
   cd JIRA_AI_BOT
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your_langchain_project
   JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token

   This will start a web interface where you can interact with the JIRA chatbot.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you will be able to:

1. **Login to JIRA**: Enter your JIRA URL, username, and API token in the sidebar to authenticate with your JIRA instance.

   - Update an issue: `Update issue ABC-123 status to "In Progress"`
   - Assign an issue: `Assign issue ABC-123 to user john_doe`
